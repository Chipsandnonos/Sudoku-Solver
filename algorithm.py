#Sudoku Solver by Rahul.G
#This is a backtracking algorithm designed to solve sudoku puzzles
#All parts of the code were developed by me

#To input your own sudoku to be solved, scroll to the bottom of the code and input the values in the variable 'b'
#None spaces are places you need to figure out, soon I will develop a GUI version, until then hand input it by changing the code

#The Algorithm and how it works
#The center of this backtracking algorithm is a recursive function which will be shown later

#How the Algorithm functions
# 1. It will first establish a possibility board, which in essence lists every possible number a space on the board can be
# 2. To make the code more efficient, the possibility board can be cleaned, this can be done by using the static cells
#    provided in the puzzle. Using these cells, several possibilities from the cells can be removed
# 3. The algorithm then starts at the first non static cell in the playing board, and extracts all of the cells possibilities from the possibility board, this list of
#    possibilities is referred to as the cache of possibilities for that iteration or frame of that function
# 4. The algorithm will pick the first entry in the cache (index 0), and add it to the board, this limits the possibilities for the rest of the board, as such the possibility board will be updated
# 5. This new board, and the possibility board are then sent as arguments for the next iteration for this recursive function
# 6. This will keep happening until a cell in the possibility board has no values left in its possibility cachel, ie. the combinations chosen have made solving the board impossible
#    when this occours the function returns false, and returns to the previous iteration. It will then try the next value in its possibility cache, repeating the same process as above
# 7. This continues until the board is solved

def solve (original_board, possibility_board, truth_board, x,y):
#Due to how python handles pointers and refferences, and functions several versions of the same board are needed, each with a different purpose
#The "root" board is a copy of the one taken in as an argument when the iteration of the function started, it is necessary for it to be copied
#as otherwise, changes to it will effect the board in previous iterations of the function which will mess up the algorithm
#These root boards will NEVER change within this iteration of the function
#The "transfer" and "updated" boards for the actual playing board and the possibility board respectively and the board which will be the boards, which will be changed
#If a new value is to be added to a cell, or an update to a cell's possibilities it would be changed on these boards not the root boards
#This was done, as if a "branch" were to fail, the original starting point was needed, so that the algorithm could try a new "branch" from its given starting point

#Paramaters
#Original Board - The starting point for this iteration
#Possibility Board - The starting possibilities of all cells, as derived from the Original board
