# Sudoku-Solver

#Made by Rahul G
#All code is made by me, not taken from anywhere else

Description:
Will solve Sudoku puzzles. To solve your own puzzle please edit the code, and change the 'b' matrix in the run function, and example is given. Indices with value 'None' mean empty spaces which the user wishes to be filled, other spaces are given in the puzzle. 

*There are 2 algorithm files, the final_algorithm is the more efficient one, is able to solve computationaly hard ones faster
but may take longer for slower ones

Next Steps:
This will be made into a GUI, and will be cleaned up to be more efficient, and also include error checking code in a given puzzle, such as if the puzzle is impossible
